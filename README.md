# Collaborative Coding and Reproducible Research
Generic repository we can use to both illustrate the use of the tools and store any/all code used to demo functionality or to create slide decks.  Everything will be fairly bare at first, but figured we could edit/update things in a single repository to show how distributed VCS tools enable all users to work on a project simultaneously without stepping on each others' toes.

# Example Scripts/Helpful Guides
We will be adding resources to the [project wiki](https://github.com/wbuchanan/sdpConvening2017/wiki/Additional-Resources) as we find new, interesting, and/or useful resources.  Additionally, we will also provide example scripts that illustrate some of the concepts we plan to discuss or things that might make it a bit easier for you and your team to get up and running with [Git](https://git-scm.com).
