# Session Information

## Description
The aim of this breakout session is to learn about collaborative tools and strategies from various agency and skill level perspectives.  This will include the tools they use, first-time user tips, and strategies for managing teams and workflows.  To best serve the SDP community, we've also attempted to make this repository the hub for our collaborative work so others are able to see the different strategies that are being used as part of this workflow.

Specifically this session will focus on leveraging the version control system [Git](https://www.git-scm.com) and the largest hosted service for [Git](https://www.git-scm.com) users [GitHub](https://github.com) with common tools used by SDP fellows [R](https://cran.r-project.org), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), [Stata](http://www.stata.com), and SQL.  After the presentations and demonstrations, there will be an open discussion with participants to answer any questions they have and for others to share their experiences and practices.


## Objectives
  1. Participants will leave the session with the foundation needed to start using [Git](https://www.git-scm.com) in their own work environments.
  2. Participants will become aware of some adoption challenges and effective strategies to manage them.
  3. Participants will gain an appreciation of the value that distributed version control systems add to collaborative problem solving, improving methodology, and increasing efficiency in the analytic pipeline.
  4. Participants will learn about product management as it applies to data analysis and data products.
